<!-- Question no. - 7 =>> What is difference between async and Defer ??
Answer =>  Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. 
           Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.

Question no. - 8 =>>          What is async in script tag?
Answer =>          The async attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the script will be 
                    executed asynchronously as soon as it is available.
Note: The async attribute is only for external scripts (and should only be used if the src attribute is present).

Question no. - 9 =>>         Should I use defer in script tag?
Answer => You should use defer for all other scripts. defer is great because it: Gets loaded as soon as possible 
â€” so it reduces load times.Doesn't execute until everything you need is ready. so all the DOM you need is there.      -->
